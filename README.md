# Hi, I'm Michelle ðŸ‘‹

Currently I'm a computer science student at Oregon State University (Graduating March 2022) and software engineer intern at InfluxData (InfluxDB). As a former science teacher who decided to transition into the tech industry, I love to continually learn and challenge myself to approach problems from different angles.
